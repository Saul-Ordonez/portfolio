            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Roswell New Mexico, <em>yes, the place with the aliens,</em> and moved up to Portland when I was 8 years old. I still have a lot of family back home that I get to visit a few times a year. Both of my parents came to the U.S. from Mexico when they were younger, seperately, and I was born in the U.S. I have two younger sisters as well. Growing up, playing concert music was a major part of my life. I played the clarinet through all of grade-school and adopted other instruments along the way. I have since stopped playing but hope that one day that spark might come back to me. My girlfriend and I hope to move out of Portland soon to a city a bit smaller for a bit of change.</p>
